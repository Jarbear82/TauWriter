# TauWriter Project Status

## Goals
Build an industrial-grade LSP and Zed extension for the TauWriter ecosystem, enabling seamless cross-referencing between prose (TWXML) and structured knowledge (HubGS).

## Implementation Progress

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Project Initialization** | ✅ | Rust workspace, Salsa DB, and Zed extension skeleton. |
| **Workspace Indexing** | ✅ | Background crawling and ingestion of all workspace files. |
| **Semantic Resolution** | ✅ | Cross-language symbol resolution (HubGS <-> TWXML). |
| **Diagnostics** | ✅ | Real-time error reporting, structural validation, and tag checking. |
| **Refactoring Support** | ✅ | Global renames and structural changes (References/Rename). |
| **AST Extraction** | ✅ | Tree-Sitter based AST extraction logic structure. |
| **Structural Awareness**| ✅ | Full index support for HubGS FIELDS, ENUMS, STRUCTS, and TWXML elements. |
| **Dynamic Evaluation**| ✅ | Engine building complete. Decorator parsing (`@computed`, `@default`), AST-based expression evaluator (arithmetic, string concatenation, unary ops, parentheses), cross-Hub field access via roles (`this.role.length`, `this.role.field`), and `@default` override enforcement. |

## Production Roadmap

| Feature | Status | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Parser Finalization** | ✅ | Generated C parsers and linked to Rust LSP via `build.rs`. |
| **Autocomplete** | ✅ | Context-aware suggestions for Hub IDs, fields, and roles. |
| **Hover Support** | ✅ | Formatted documentation display with Hub details. |
| **Type-checking** | ✅ | Validation of Hub roles, multiplicities, and field types. |
| **Semantic Tokens** | ✅ | Advanced context-aware syntax highlighting for all symbols. |
| **Import Scoping** | ✅ | Respects `IMPORTS` statements for scoped symbol resolution. |
| **Folding Ranges** | ✅ | Support for collapsing blocks, sections, and definitions. |
| **Workspace Symbol** | ✅ | Searching for Hubs and Types across the entire project. |
| **Testing Suite** | ✅ | Broad integration test coverage for LSP handlers, Salsa queries, and validation pipeline. Some handlers have minimal tests (e.g., didSave). |
| **CI/CD** | ✅ | Automated GitHub Actions for multi-platform binary distribution.
| **Zed Extension** | ⚠️  | Functional skeleton with grammars, language configs, and pre-built binaries in `extension/bin/`. Auto-downloading and one-click install require Zed marketplace verification. |
| **Editor QoL** | 🔄 | Tag auto-closing, snippet generation, and structural autocomplete for TWXML. |

## Current Focus

### 1. Structural Enforcement & Validation Pipeline ✅
Strict schema enforcement for document and graph structures to ensure data integrity.
- [x] **TWXML Skeleton Enforcement:** Validate that all TWXML documents strictly adhere to the root <document> schema containing exactly one <metadata> block (housing <meta/> tags) and one <body> block.
- [x] **HubGS Dependency Validation:** Enforce section-level dependencies. If an `INSTANCES` block exists, validate that a `DEFINITIONS` block is present locally or fully satisfied via an `IMPORTS` statement.
- [x] **Instance Resolution:** Ensure all declared instances successfully resolve to a defined Hub type.
- [x] Implement TWXML Nesting Rules (e.g., `<heading>` levels inside `<body>` or `<section>`)
- [x] Implement TWXML Referential Integrity (Unresolved references for `<hubref>`)
- [x] Implement HubGS Type & Multiplicity Enforcement

### 2. Dynamic Evaluation Engine ✅
Robust engine for computed graph data.
- [x] Implement AST evaluator for `@computed` formulas (arithmetic, string concatenation).
- [x] Implement cross-Hub field access via roles (e.g., `this.companions.length`).
- [x] Enforce `@default` override rules during instance instantiation.

### 3. Editor Experience & LSP Capabilities (In Progress)
Enhancing the writing and data-entry flow natively within the editor.
- [ ] **TWXML Tag Auto-completion:** Context-aware suggestions for structural tags (`<section>`, `<heading>`, `<body>`).
- [ ] **TWXML Tag Auto-closing:** Automatically generate closing tags (e.g., typing `<metadata>` inserts `</metadata>`).
- [x] Context-aware autocomplete for Hub IDs, fields, and roles.

### 4. Formatter Module (`tauwriter-fmt`) (In Progress)
- [ ] Refactor formatting engine to natively support the new TWXML `<metadata>` and `<body>` skeleton.
- [ ] Standardize indentation and line-breaking rules for nested TWXML blocks.
- [x] Integrate LSP `textDocument/formatting` handler.
